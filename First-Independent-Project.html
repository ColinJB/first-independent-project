      <h2>Project Portfolio</h2>
      <!--Beginning of List of Projects and Descriptions-->
      <p>
        Hello everyone! Welcome to my Project Portfolio. Since beginning
        Epicodus, I have created a couple projects thus far. Feel free to check them out below:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/ColinJB/interior">Interior Decoration</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For this project, my task was to create a website for the beginning,during, and after stages of an interior decoration project. I actually went a step further and started from the build! For this site, I utilized HTML & CSS. Within the CSS, I added media queries, classes, and id's.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/ColinJB/favorite-band">Favorite Band</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
              My favorite bands page contains a very simple layout featuring the one-and-only, Vanilla Ice. Granted, Vanilla Ice is'nt my favorite musician;or anyone's for that matter; but I do fancy his patriotic jumpsuits. Utilizing HTML & CSS, I gave this site a colored sidebar and columns.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/ColinJB/blog">Apocolypse Blog</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The end of days is upon us. I am fortunate enough to possess a computer with a wireless connection somehow, so I begin a blog recounting my attempts at continued survival. This sit is coded in HTML & CSS. This is the page where I learned about and experimented with lorem ipsum, divs and spans.o
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/ColinJB/boring-lecture">Sheep Sleep Patterns</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
              What do sheep dream about? Do they count Humans? These are the hard hitting questions I would've tackled in my "Boring Lecture" project, had I not written the content in Lorem Ipsum. Using HTML & CSS, I utilized classes as well as creating a rendered image background.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/ColinJB/Cupcake-Shop">Heavenly Cupcakes</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Who says you need to die to go to Heaven? For this project I created a webpage for a cupcake shop that IS to die for! Luckily you don't have to!! Making use of CSS & HTML to create the page, I also linked an email address for the first time on this page.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/ColinJB/Island_Resort">Sri Lankan Lagoon</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Welcome!! Take a load off! Here at the beautiful and exotic island resort of Sri Lanka, we guarantee you will have an experience you'll never forget. For this webpage, I used HTML & CSS. I experimented with creating a background using a repeated GIF, and also incorporated a nav bar.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/ColinJB/Favorites">Favorite NBA Teams</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Listing out my favorite NBA teams and players, I stayed true to my hometown by linking the homepage of the Atlanta Hawks website. This site was created with HTML & CSS.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/ColinJB/Favorite-Places">Favorite Places</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Hopefully I will get to visit and experience the culture and landscape of all of these places within my lifetime. This page was written in HTML & CSS, and apparently before I knew how to resize images!
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/ColinJB/paragraph-repo">Example Paragraph Repository</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Getting to the earlier stages of my personal web development production, this is a very basic example page with colored headers of different sizes and a paragraph; written in HTML & CSS.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/ColinJB/my-first-webpage">My First Webpage</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
              First webpage that I created, featuring a very basic design with a picture of a Moose. HTML & CSS were used.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/ColinJB/goodbye">Global Goodbyes</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
              About as basic as it gets, a page with multiple languages of Goodbye written. HTML & CSS were used.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/ColinJB/hello-world">Hello World</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The start of my Coding Journey! Look out world!!
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Colin, which I'm assuming you know at this point. I consider my hometown to be Atlanta, considering that is where I spent the majority of my life. I was born in Park Ridge, Illinois; although we moved while I was still an infant. From there, my family and I moved to Maryland, then Georgia, then Massachusetts, back to Georgia, down to Orlando, and the finally back to good ole' Georgia again. My father is in the hotel business, hence the constant relocations. My pops is in sales; always has been. I follow his foot steps when I was out of high school. I've held a few different sales positions, and it really comes naturally to me. It taught me a lot about business and the sales process in general. However, I have a greater vision of what I would like to accomplish in my lifetime. Money is not my motivation. I hope to learn the skills necessary that will enable me to create a platform of positive and tangible change within the world.
      </p>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        I graduated from Etowah High School in 2012. As I stated previously, I jumped head first into the sales realm of business; and excelled. The only significant education I received other than that was my attendance of the National Youth Leadership Forum on Medicine at Emory University. I was invited based off of my performance on standardized tests and my interest in the medical field. I have strayed away from the medical field for a couple of reasons. My interest in technology for one. Two, my interest in business. Three, and most importantly, my desire to possess the skills necessary to positively influence the world in as large a way as possible.
      </p>
      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>
        My largest interest is personal growth. I hope to backpack the world and experience as many different cultures as I can. I once told myself, that I would like to experience anything that brings joy to anyone. Not as easy as it sounds. Sometimes the things that bring the greatest joy, also elicit the greatest fear. Such is life. However, on a slightly less abstract note, here are some of the things I enjoy right now:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Cooking. For myself, but especially others. Few things engage all the senses so vividly. Plus, the satisfaction of seeing the smiles and receiving the gratitude of friends and loved ones when you feed them a delicious meal, is second to none. Who doesn't like some good grub?
        </li>
        <li>
          The outdoors. My mother bought me a shirt that says "Nature is cheaper than therapy"; and lords knows that is true. In such trying times as these, we could all afford to gain some of the peace and clarity that Mother Nature so heartily offers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Basketball. I'm not a big fan of really any other sport. I grew up with my best friend aiming to join the NBA. Between growing up and shooting hoops constantly with him, to watching him climb the ranks and play for a Division 1 school; basketball definitely holds a place in my heart.
        </li>
        <li>
          Philosophy and Politics. Few things intrigue me more than Philosophy and Politics; in that order. If the world would consider them together more often, I think we might all be in a better place.
        </li>
