      <h2>Project Portfolio</h2>
      <!--Beginning of List of Projects and Descriptions-->
      <p>
        Hello everyone! Welcome to my Project Portfolio. Since beginning
        Epicodus, I have created a couple projects thus far. Feel free to check them out below:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/ColinJB/interior">Interior Decoration</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For this project, my task was to create a website for the beginning,during, and after stages of an interior decoration project. I actually went a step further and started from the build! For this site, I utilized HTML & CSS. Within the CSS, I added media queries, classes, and id's.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/ColinJB/favorite-band">Favorite Band</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
              My favorite bands page contains a very simple layout featuring the one-and-only, Vanilla Ice. Granted, Vanilla Ice is'nt my favorite musician;or anyone's for that matter; but I do fancy his patriotic jumpsuits. Utilizing HTML & CSS, I gave this site a colored sidebar and columns.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/ColinJB/blog">Apocolypse Blog</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The end of days is upon us. I am fortunate enough to possess a computer with a wireless connection somehow, so I begin a blog recounting my attempts at continued survival. This sit is coded in HTML & CSS. This is the page where I learned about and experimented with lorem ipsum, divs and spans.o
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/ColinJB/boring-lecture">Sheep Sleep Patterns</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
              What do sheep dream about? Do they count Humans? These are the hard hitting questions I would've tackled in my "Boring Lecture" project, had I not written the content in Lorem Ipsum. Using HTML & CSS, I utilized classes as well as creating a rendered image background.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/ColinJB/Cupcake-Shop">Heavenly Cupcakes</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Who says you need to die to go to Heaven? For this project I created a webpage for a cupcake shop that IS to die for! Luckily you don't have to!! Making use of CSS & HTML to create the page, I also linked an email address for the first time on this page.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/ColinJB/Island_Resort">Sri Lankan Lagoon</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Welcome!! Take a load off! Here at the beautiful and exotic island resort of Sri Lanka, we guarantee you will have an experience you'll never forget. For this webpage, I used HTML & CSS. I experimented with creating a background using a repeated GIF, and also incorporated a nav bar.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/ColinJB/Favorites">Favorite NBA Teams</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Listing out my favorite NBA teams and players, I stayed true to my hometown by linking the homepage of the Atlanta Hawks website. This site was created with HTML & CSS.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/ColinJB/Favorite-Places">Favorite Places</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Hopefully I will get to visit and experience the culture and landscape of all of these places within my lifetime. This page was written in HTML & CSS, and apparently before I knew how to resize images!
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/ColinJB/paragraph-repo">Example Paragraph Repository</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Getting to the earlier stages of my personal web development production, this is a very basic example page with colored headers of different sizes and a paragraph; written in HTML & CSS.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/ColinJB/my-first-webpage">My First Webpage</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
              First webpage that I created, featuring a very basic design with a picture of a Moose. HTML & CSS were used.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/ColinJB/goodbye">Global Goodbyes</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
              About as basic as it gets, a page with multiple languages of Goodbye written. HTML & CSS were used.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/ColinJB/hello-world">Hello World</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The start of my Coding Journey! Look out world!!
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
